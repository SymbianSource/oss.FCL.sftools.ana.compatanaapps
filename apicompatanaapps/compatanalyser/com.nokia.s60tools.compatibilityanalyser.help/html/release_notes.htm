<h3><a name="description"></a>Product description</h3>

<p>The Compatibility Analyser tool compares a set of files in two different
versions of Symbian releases against a predefined Binary Compatibility (BC)
criteria, and reports any changes that affect BC. The analysis is done on
header files or import libraries of the platform source code. </p>

<p>The Compatibility Analyser tool is integrated to the Carbide.c++ IDE and
provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the tool's core components,
<i>BCTools</i> script package. In addition to using the default files that are
delivered with the Carbide tool, you can also use core components, for example,
from a Web server. </p>

<p>Compatibility reports can be filtered so that they compare the found issues
against a <i>knownissues.xml </i> file. This file shows whether or not the same
BC problems have occurred before in the Symbian platform. </p>

<p>Both the core components and <i>knownissues.xml </i> files can be retrieved
from a Web server to use the latest versions. This ensures that the results of
your BC analysis are always up-to-date and do not show, for example, known
issues that are already fixed in the platform. </p>

<h3><a name="features"></a>Main features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UI for analysing header files, library files, or both types at the same
    time. </li>
  <li>UI for filtering existing reports generated by the core components. </li>
  <li>UI for selecting the current release and baseline SDKs. The tool
    automatically displays the SDKs installed in your local file system. </li>
  <li>UI for selecting core components from different places, for example, a
    Web server.</li>
  <li>UI for specifying the used <i>knownissues.xml</i> files from different
    locations, for example, a Web server. </li>
  <li>Support for analysing DLL files. </li>
  <li>Support for specifying forced header files, multiple header directories
    and multiple library directories. </li>
  <li>Support for opening the report files in an XML editor. </li>
  <li>Support for fetching User, System Includes and Forced Headers
    automatically from the provided <i>bld.inf</i> path in the <b>Baseline
    Editor</b>.</li>
  <li>Predefined baseline profiles for Symbian SDK Version 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 5.0 releases. </li>
  <li>Possibility to run analysis on a selected sub-folder of a project, in
    addition to the entire project. </li>
  <li>The tool supports GCCE toolchain (tested with CSL Arm Toolchain) and RVCT
    toolchain.</li>
  <li>The tools does not support WIN*, "TOOLS* target types.</li>
  <li>Supports Symbian OS versions 9.x.</li>
  <li>Option to save the settings of an analysis into a configuration file
    (<i>.comptanalyser</i>) and use this file to re-run the analysis. This
    saves the time of going through the wizard when there are no changes in the
    configuration. </li>
