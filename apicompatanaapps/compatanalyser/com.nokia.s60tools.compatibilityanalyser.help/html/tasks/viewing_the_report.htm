<h2>Viewing the reports</h2>
<p>After the Compatibility Analyser Wizard
or the Report Filter Wizard has finished, you can view the reports of the
analysis. The reports are in XML format and listed on the Compatibility Analyser
view, as shown in the example below. The view also has a right-click menu
for certain operations.</p>

<p>For more information on filtering, see <a href="filtering_existing_reports.htm">
Filtering existing reports</a>.</p>

<h3>Opening the reports</h3>
<p>You can also view the list of issue files for the selected report file in the right side tree view. 
Double-clicking a file name or issue will open the file in the editor view.</p>
<p>To open a report for an analysis: </p>
<ul>
<li>Select a report, right-click and select <b>Open</b>.</li>
<li>Double-click a selected file.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, the report is opened in the built-in Editor of Carbide.c++, for HTML files. </p>

<p>The browser formats the layout with an Extensible Stylesheet Language
(XSL) file, <i>BBCResults.xsl</i>. It is copied to the output directory automatically.
</p>
<p>You can also open the report in an XML editor: </p>
<ol>
<li>Select one or more reports. </li>
<li>Right-click the items and select <b>Open With > XML Editor</b>.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The value of the field <b>Last Modification Time</b> specifies the
last modification time of the report by the tool. </li>
<li>The value of the field <b>Report Filtered</b> specifies whether the
report is filtered or not by the tool. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also view the list of issue files for the selected report file in the right side tree view. 
For header report, header files in that report and issues in those files are grouped into <b>BCIssues</b> and <b>SCIssues</b>.
Similarly, for library report, library files in that report and issues in those files are grouped into <b>BCIssues</b> and <b>SCIssues</b>.</p>

<p>Double-clicking a header file or issue will open the header file in the editor view. You can also compare the current header file with the baseline header file by selecting the option <b>Compare with baseline</b> in the context menu of an issue file in the tree view. A proper error message will be displayed if the current or baseline header file does not exist.</p>

<p>Double-clicking an issue of any library file will open the corresponding MMP file or source file in an editor view. For example, if the selected issue is related to the method modified or added, then the source file is opened. If the selected issue is related to UID or capability, then MMP file is opened. A proper error message will be displayed if MMP/source files do not exist
or if the tool is not able to identify the MMP/source file. </p>
