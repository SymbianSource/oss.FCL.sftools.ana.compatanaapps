<h2>Configuring the knownissues.xml file</h2>
<h5>Before you start</h5>
<p>When checking for Binary Compatibility (BC), Compatibility Analyser produces
a report that lists those issues that may affect BC. You can filter these
reports so that they compare the found issues against a <i>knownissues.xml
</i> file. This file contains information on whether or not the same BC problems
have occurred before in the Symbian platform and what should be done about them. 
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If the <i>knownissues.xml</i> file does not return any
information, the BC issue in question is new and introduced by the product.
In this case, consult a Binary Compatibility expert who can carry out further
analysis.</p>
<p>To configure this file, do the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>In the <b>Knownissues</b> dialog, select any of the following options:
	<ul>
	<li>Use the default <i>knownissues.xml</i> files supplied with the tool.</li>
	<li>Use a <i>knownissues.xml</i> file from a Web server by defining an URL.
	<p><b>Tip:</b> This option ensures that the latest version of this file is always
	used and the compatibility reports do not list known issues that are already fixed. </p></li>
	<li>Use a list of <i>knownissues.xml</i> files from a Web server by defining an URL. </li>
	<li>Browse for <i>knownissues.xml</i> files from your local file system.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>
