<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Compatibility Analyser compares a set of files in two different versions 
of Symbian releases against a predefined Binary Compatibility (BC) criteria, 
and reports any changes that affect BC. The analysis is done on header files 
or import libraries of the platform source code. Preserving BC is central in 
Symbian development to ensure that any executable that was built against an older 
version can be run without changes on a newer 
version of the platform.</p>
<p>The comparison is made between a baseline version of a Symbian release 
and a newer version of the release, that needs to be verified. Changes such as adding 
new code, or modifying or deleting existing code can break the compatibility. 
See the following figure for an overview of the process: </p>

<p>Compatibility reports can be filtered so that they compare the found issues 
against set of issues, listed in a <i>knownissues.xml</i> file. This file contains information on 
whether or not the same BC problems have occurred before in the Symbian platform 
and what should be done about them. If the <i>knownissues.xml</i> file does not 
return any information, the BC issue is new and introduced by the product.</p>
