<h2>Software Development Kit (SDK)</h2>
<p>To analyse compatibility, you must have a Symbian based Software Development Kit 
(SDK) installed on your workstation. An SDK contains the tools, 
documentation and code examples that support the development of applications.</p>
<p>To configure SDKs in Carbide.c++, go to <b>Windows > Preferences > Carbide.c++ > 
SDK Preferences > Add New SDK</b>, and select the SDK to be added.</p>

<h3>Baseline SDK and Current SDK</h3>
<p>To analyse possible compatibility breaks between different versions of header
and library files, two types of SDKs should be defined: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Baseline SDK:</b> The SDK that is used to build/compile the given header
and library files. The version number of this SDK must be less than the current
SDK.</li>
<li><b>Current release SDK:</b> The SDK that is used to build/compile the
given current header and library files. The version number of this SDK must
be greater than the baseline SDK.</li>
</ul>
