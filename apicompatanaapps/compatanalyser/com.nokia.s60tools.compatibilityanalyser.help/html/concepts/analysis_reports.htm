<h2>Issues in compatibility reports</h2>
<p>After Compatibility Analyser has run the analysis, the generated reports 
are listed in the application's view. Some items are reported differently, 
depending on whether the report is for header or library files.</p>
<p>On the report, you can also view the OK cases that did not have compatibility problems.</p>

<h3>Reading the report</h3>
<p>The first part of the report lists general information such
as the creation date, the baseline and current versions, and the parameters
used. See the following example:</p>
<p><img src="images\report_sample.png" alt="Sample compatibility analysis report"></p>

<p>The second part contains the BC breaks that were found. For each header file with problems, the baseline
header file and the matching current header file are listed. Below them, the
changes that may affect the BC are listed. Each issue contains: </p>
<ul>
<li>a description of the problem, </li>
<li>the cause, and </li>
<li>the level of severity: <i>BBC Break</i>, <i>Possible BBC Break</i> or <i>Informative</i>. For example:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images\breaks_sample.png" alt="Sample of reports BBC Breaks and possible BC Breaks"></p>

<p>For libraries, each issue contains: </p>
<ul>
<li>the type of change (added, modified, deleted), </li>
<li>where it occurred,</li>
<li>details, and</li>
<li>the level of severity: <i>BBC Break</i>, <i>Possible BBC Break</i> or <i>Informative</i>. For example: </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images\lib_breaks_sample.png" alt="Sample of library analysis BBC breaks"></p>

<h3>Analysing the findings</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Informative</b> items are reported to help the analyst and do not as
such constitute a BC break. </li>
<li>Items marked as <b>BBC Break</b> or <b>Possible BBC Break</b> need to
be analyzed to determine whether they are breaks or not. Some of the breaks
come from the platform and some are introduced by the product. </li>
</ul>

<p>To ease the analysis of the report, make sure that you have the report
generated for the platform release the product is based on, as well as a list
of known issues (see <a href="../tasks/knownissues.htm">Configuring the knownissues.xml
file</a>) in the platform. For each break (or possible break) in the product,
the report for the platform is then checked. </p>
<ul>
<li>If the break is also in the platform, you can check the list of known
issues and see whether it is a real BC break.</li>
<li>If the break is not a known break in the platform, it has usually been
introduced by the product. In this case, consult a binary compatibility expert
who can carry out further analysis.</li>
</ul>
