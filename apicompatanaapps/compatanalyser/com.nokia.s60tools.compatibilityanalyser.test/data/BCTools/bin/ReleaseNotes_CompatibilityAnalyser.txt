RELEASE NOTES - COMPATIBILITY ANALYSER v2.8.0
RELEASED 19th June 2009 

SUPPORTS S60 3.0+

===============================================================================

Product Description:
====================

Compatibility Analyser compares a set of files in two different versions of S60
releases against predefined Binary Compatibility (BC) criteria, and reports any
changes that affect BC. The analysis is done on header files or import
libraries of the platform. Preserving BC is central in S60 development to
ensure that any executable that was built against an older version (for
example, S60 3.0 platform) can be run without changes on a newer version of the
platform (for example, S60 3.1 onwards). The comparison is made between a
baseline version of an S60 release (for example, a Public SDK from Forum Nokia)
and a newer, current SDK version that needs to be verified. Compatibility
reports can be filtered so that they compare the found issues against a known
issues file. This file (knownissues.xml) contains information on whether or not
the same BC problems have occurred before in the S60 Platform and what should
be done about them.

Compatibility Analyser uses three additional utilities for the analysis process,
HeaderAnalyser, LibraryAnalyser and BCFilter. Please see the release notes of
those tools for details.

Main Features:
==============
- By using static analysis for header and import library files, you can find
  binary and source compatibility issues by comparing a baseline and current
  release
- Analysis can be done for a whole release, for a set of files or for a single
  file
- Generated report files can be filtered by using a known issues file
