RELEASE NOTES - HEADERANALYSER v1.6.0
RELEASED 19th June 2009

SUPPORTS S60 3.0+

===============================================================================

Product Description:
====================
The purpose of the HeaderAnalyser tool is to compare a set of modified header
files to those in a baseline and report any changes that may affect binary
compatibility. HeaderAnalyser has a command line interface and can read its
parameters from a configuration file. The tool produces an XML file which lists
all such changes. Usually the baseline is an SDK and the modified header files
are the header files found in the product's epoc32\include directory and its
subdirectories.

Main Features:
==============
- Read different versions of header files and check binary compatibility
  issues between them
- Compare two header files
- Compare two directories
- Compare two file sets
- Compare renamed files
- Generate an XML report file

===============================================================================

What's New in v1.6.0
====================
- Feature: Added support to verify .rh files
- Feature: Added support to verify QT headers
- Change: Analysis time reduced by 25%-30%, using multiple threads
- Fix: Program terminated unexpectedly when checking for include guard

===============================================================================

Installation Notes:
===================
HeaderAnalyser is part of Compatibility Analyser tool suite. Please refer to
Compatibility Analyser documentation for details.

===============================================================================

System Requirements:

- Windows 2000 or XP with 256MB RAM

===============================================================================

Compatibility Issues:
=====================
N/A

===============================================================================

Known Issues:
=============
- HeaderAnalyser is used for compliling header files, not actual sources of
  components. Therefore compilation errors may happen easily due to missing
  includes or wrong system include paths. Please refer to Compatibility
  Analyser documentation for how to overcome this problem.
